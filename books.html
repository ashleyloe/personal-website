        <h2><i>Dark Triumph</i><br>by Robin LaFevers</h2><br>
        <img src= "darktriumph.jpg" border = "0" alt= "Champion" width= "76.7" height="111.7"; style = "float: left; margin: 0 6px 6px 0;"/>
 <p>After reading about Ismae&#39;s journey to the sanctuary of St. Mortain&#39;s doorstep in GRAVE MERCY, I was thrilled to find out that Sybella&#39;s story was going to be told. In comparison, Sybella&#39;s journey in DARK TRIUMPH by Robin LaFevers was much darker and more action-packed than Ismae&#39;s.</p>
<p>	Despite her abuse at the hands of d&#39;Albret, the abbess forces Sybella to return to his household. Only later on in the book do readers find out that the cruel and merciless d&#39;Albret is actually Sybella&#39;s father. As the story progresses, Sybella&#39;s long-repressed memories resurface and she relives them in a series of flashbacks that show d&#39;Albret as a ruthless, unfeeling tyrant.</p>

<p>Much of Sybella&#39;s personality is shaped by a dark past, a fact that she makes no attempt to hide. She&#39;s fiercely independent and sure in her own skills, both in and out of battle. Sybella has no great internal struggle with killing people. She&#39;s merciless in the way she doles out death and takes a fierce pride in her ability to do so. Her scars and bruises are a well-earned mark of pride, borne of years spent honing her technique.</p>
<p>	Sybella&#39;s relationship with the Beast of Waroch progresses from one borne of survival --- they must journey across the land to return to the Duchess&#39;s side --- to one of mutual respect and affection. Beast is bluntly described by all to be a largely ugly, hulking creature. Yet his heart of gold is unimaginable as he strives to protect Sybella as he fights alongside her. As Sybella&#39;s romantic interest, he&#39;s nothing like the knights in shining armor --- he&#39;s a true warrior, loyal and lionhearted to the core. Their slowly developing relationship progresses from grudging respect to genuine admiration. Beast grows to understand that Sybella is only herself when she&#39;s fighting off would-be assassins and foiling traitorous plots. He also understands that she&#39;s capable of protecting herself, especially after she rescues him from d&#39;Albret&#39;s prison and protects him as he recovers from his injuries.</p>
<p>	What I enjoyed about this book was how strongly LaFevers characterized Sybella, and the way she developed over the course of the book. LaFevers showed much of Sybella&#39;s background to illustrate how horribly she was mistreated and what terrors she had encountered. And while Sybella thought that her inability to act and stand up for others made her a coward, LaFevers makes it clear that Sybella displayed courage and strength just by surviving her ordeal. At the same time, Sybella&#39;s time with Beast allows her to let down her<br />
	emotional barriers and recover the parts of her that she had shut away to protect herself while she had endured d&#39;Albret&#39;s household. Slowly, Sybella begins to trust people again, as she glimpses the good in humankind that was so absent from her life with d&#39;Albret. She also<br />
	strengthens her friendship with Ismae as she is united with her at the duchesses&#39; household. Sybella begins to heal and leave behind her memories of the d&#39;Albret household and makes new ones surrounded by the people that love her.</p>
