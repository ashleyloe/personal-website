<h1>Design Document</h1>
Mission: My mission was to create my own personal website to display my interests. I also wanted a place to have my resume be online in order
for potential employers to find me as well as to become aware of my interests. My requirements included a need for a page
that had a brief blurb about myself, a page that included links to my writing (past and current), a page that included a brief preview
of what books I like and how I review them, a page that would link to my resume, and a contact me page.

<h2>Required Elements:</h2>
<strong>Style sheets </strong>
My style sheet was pretty basic and just contained different types of headers with different sized fonts and styles
for my website. It also contained the basic layout of my page, which I wanted to be professional (which explains the lack of a logo) and to be honest, a bit
author-ish. I used to want to become a famous author when I was younger, so in a way I was doing a little throwback to my pre-CS major self.

The layout has a sidebar as well to continue this theme, with links to my reviews, interesting articles, and books I'm currently reading.

Overall, the website has a nav bar that indicates which page the user is currently on and has links to other pages of the website.

The user feedback includes links that underline and change color as they are hovered over.

<b>Forms:</b> my form element was my on my contact me page. The forms gives a place for the user to
add their name and email address, as well as check a box to indicate what they wanted to contact me about.
The form has feedback so if the user doesn't fill in a blank, the form will pop up and display and error message.
The form also checks if the user has entered a valid email address.

<b>Local Storage:</b> I made use of the local storage by having a counter that would alert the user to how many times
they have visited the site. It's only on the main page because I didn't want to annoy the user each time they visited another page
of the same blog.

<b>User Interaction:</b> The user can change the background of each page (both for readability and customization issues). 



<b>Potential Copyright Issues:</b> I only used 3 pictures found on the internet: the mouse pointer icon, which was from a
stock website and edited on photoshop, and the 2 book covers. The cover for <i>The Dark Triumph</i> by Robin Lafevers is copyright
her Publisher: Houghton Mifflin Books for Children and <i>Legend</i> by Marie Lu is copyright her Publisher: G. P. Putnam's Sons, Penguin Books.
